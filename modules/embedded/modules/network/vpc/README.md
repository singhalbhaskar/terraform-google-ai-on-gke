## Description

This module creates a new [VPC network][vpc] with 1 or more subnetworks and
a [Cloud Router][router] for every region with a subnetwork. By default, it will
create:

* A [Cloud NAT][nat] to enable outbound access to the public internet for VMs
  without public IP addresses; VMs with public IP addresses bypass the NAT to
  directly access the public internet
* A firewall rule that enables inbound SSH access from [Identity-Aware
  Proxy][iap]
* A firewall rule that enables all traffic internal to the network

This behavior is optional and can be configured as [described below](#inputs).
This module is based on networking support in the [Cloud Foundation
Toolkit][cft]. We recommend following the [documentation for the network
module][cft-network] and [submodules][cft-network-submodules] for more details.
In particular, the detailed structure of input variables can be found for:

* [var.firewall\_rules](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-network/tree/v5.1.0/modules/firewall-rules#inputs)
* [var.secondary\_ranges](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-network/tree/v5.1.0/modules/subnets#inputs)

Additionally, [Google Private Access][gpa] is enabled by default on all
subnetworks unless it is explicitly disabled. This setting ensures that all VMs
can use Google services such as [Cloud Storage][gcs] even if they do not have
public IP addresses or Cloud NAT is disabled.

### Example

This creates a new VPC network named `cluster-net`.

```yaml
  - id: network1
    source: modules/network/vpc
    settings:
      network_name: cluster-net
```

### Deprecation warning

The variables listed below have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
release. Until they are removed,You may continue to use them in Toolkit
blueprints with the same functionality as documented in the [Toolkit 1.0
release][vpc1.0].

* Deprecated variables
  * `var.primary_subnetwork`
  * `var.additional_subnetworks`
  * `var.subnetwork_size`

[vpc1.0]: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/hpc-toolkit/blob/v1.0.0/modules/network/vpc/README.md

The following variables have been added to support explicit IP ranges for
subnetworks while retaining existing functionality. We advise adopting them even
if not using explicit IP ranges . The Toolkit ***does not support*** mixing
deprecated variables with the new replacements. The new functionality is
described in [more detail below](#subnetworks).

* New variables to adopt
  * `var.subnetworks`
    * A value for this can be generated by merging `var.primary_subnetwork` and
    `var.additional_subnetworks` into a single list
  * `var.default_primary_subnetwork_size`
    * This variable has been renamed for clarity; its value can be directly
    copied from an explicit setting for `var.subnetwork_size`; if your blueprint
    does not have an explicit setting, the default values are the same

### Subnetworks

This module will always provision at least 1 "primary" subnetwork in which most
resources are expected to be provisioned. This primary subnetwork is determined
by

1. The first element of [var.subnetworks](#input_subnetworks) if it is not the
   empty list
2. A default subnetwork automatically calculated from
   * [var.subnetwork_name](#input_subnetwork_name)
   * [var.region](#input_region)
   * [var.network_address_range](#input_network_address_range)
   * [var.default_primary_subnetwork_size](#input_default_primary_subnetwork_size)

If `var.subnetworks` is provided then the primary subnetwork name is taken
explicitly from it and `var.subnetwork_name` is ignored.

`var.subnetworks` behaves identically to the [Cloud Foundation Toolkit subnets
module][cftsubnets] with the lone exception that one can provide ***one*** of
the following settings for each subnetwork:

* `new_bits`
* `subnet_ip`

If each subnetwork defines `subnet_ip` then these are taken to be their explicit
CIDR IP ranges. If each subnetwork defines `new_bits`, then these are taken to
be the size of the CIDR subnetwork (in bits). IP ranges for each subnetwork are
calculated using `var.network_address_range` as the base IP, producing the most
compact set of subnetworks possible.

> **_NOTE:_** we do not presently support the modification of individual subnetworks
> when using this module to provision more than 1 subnetwork using automatically
> calculated IP ranges based upon `new_bits`. Doing so will cause IP ranges to be
> recalculated for each subnetwork. We advise appending new subnetworks to the end
> of `var.subnetworks`.

### SSH Access

By default a firewall rule is created to allow inbound SSH access from
[Identity-Aware Proxy][iap]. A user must have the `IAP-Secured Tunnel User`
(`roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor`) IAM role to be able to SSH over IAP.

To allow regular SSH access from a known IP address you can add the following
`firewall_rules` setting to the `vpc` module:

```yaml
  - id: network1
    source: modules/network/vpc
    settings:
      firewall_rules:
      - name: ssh-my-machine
        direction: INGRESS
        ranges: [<your-ip-address>/32]
        allow:
        - protocol: tcp
          ports: [22]
```

> **Note**: You must populate the above example with the source IP address from
> which you plan to SSH from. You can use a service like
> [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com) to determine your IP address.
